# Notes web app using React - Firebase

This is a web application which hepls the user to create notes.

I have created this application with the guidance of Joe taught at [Scrimba] (https://scrimba.com/playlist/pKNqYAZ) platform.

To make use of this code please follow the below instructions:

1. Download the repository
2. In the terminal run the following commands
    - npm install
    - npm run dev
3. Copy the url generated after running the above command

This application uses Firebase as its backend so please make sure to update the firebase.js file with your firebase account configurations.
